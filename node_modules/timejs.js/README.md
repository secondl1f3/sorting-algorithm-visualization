## Welcome to time.js documentation

Thanks to this script you can view the time and much more related to numbers.
Script created by [Leszek Korzan](https://www.github.com/leszekkeu)

**Version 3.0.4**
### Implementation

The implementation is very simple. Just add a file with the `time.js` script at the end of the `body` section.

```javascript
<script src="time.js"></script>
```
or
```javascript
<script src="https://www.leszekk.eu/cdn/time.min.js"></script>
```

For the script to work, you must call the `time()` function.

### Usage

The use is easy because you only have to add the item to the html code.

**Types of elements**
```markdown
#fulldate - e.g. 01.01.2019|11:59:59

#day - e.g. 1 -> day of month
#month - e.g. 1 -> month number
#year - e.g. 2019

#hour
#minute
#secound

#dayofweek - e.g. Monday
```
**Example**
```javascript
<div id="fulldate"></div>
```

### countup() function

//10 - To what number the animation should take place.
//1000 - Every few milliseconds an animation should take place.
//"some-id" - The ID of the element to be used for the process.
